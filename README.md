# Open Currency Converter

<img src="https://ps.w.org/artiss-currency-converter/assets/icon.svg" align="left" style="padding-right: 20px">If you have a wish to convert currencies "on the fly" within the text of a post or page then this is the plugin for you! It's free to download, free to use and advert free - if you think you have to pay for something you're doing it wrong!

So, let's say you run a UK based site and will refer to currencies in GBP. However, the majority of visitors are from the US, so you may have a wish to also show the dollar equivalent. Using this plugin you can do this without having to work out the conversion and then re-visit it in future to take into account conversion changes.

Features include...

* No need to update exchange rates yourself - data is fetched from an Open Source API
* Over 170 currencies supported
* An easy to use shortcode for embedding directly into your posts and pages
* A PHP function for those people who wish to add features in their theme
* Results can be cached, reducing resources and improving response
* Template to allow you to control how results are output
* Administration screen allowing you to define defaults and to view current exchange rates
